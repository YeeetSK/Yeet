    <p class="AboutMe">Hi, I’m Yeet. I will tell you some things about me now. I like technology and computers; I'm interested in computer gadgets.
 
        And currently, I’m also quite interested in different AI bots like Chat-Gpt or Stable Diffusion, I find the AI quite interesting and also helpfull.I’m also interested in coding. I have learned a few programming languages, like HTML and CSS. And also the basics of Python and LUA; I also used HTML and CSS. to make this website. 
        
        I’m also currently a student, and I play basketball, which is one of my bigger sports interests. I also think that I'm quite fast learning, and that if I need to learn new things, I am able to understand them.</p>

    <p class="Experience">First of all, I have experience as a moderator on several smaller servers that are no longer active,
        or were sold by their owners. This role taught me the basics of using commands, handling tickets, 
        communicating effectively with people, and explaining things clearly when someone needed help. 
        
        Additionally, I was promoted from Team Manager to Co-Owner on one server, which was a Minecraft
        client. However, the owners decided to stop working on the server, resulting in its closure. Nevertheless,
        this experience provided me with valuable skills in moderating and managing different aspects, such 
        as working with more people, creating ideas for the server and implementing them, managing staff 
        applications, creating an effective ticket system with the TICKETS bot, assigning tasks to individuals, 
        and designing with Figma software.
        
        I will happily learn new things to make my experience better, so if you’re thinking about hiring me for
        your discord server, i will be happy to help and happy to learn the new things you learn me.</p>
